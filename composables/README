# Composables

This folder contains a collection of reusable, reactive composable functions for Vue.js applications.

Each composable is designed to solve a specific problem, from managing state to interacting with browser APIs, while remaining lightweight and independent. This allows you to cherry-pick the utilities you need without adding a large library as a dependency.

## Available Composables

### `useBreakpoints`

A composable for checking the current window's screen size based on predefined breakpoints. It's a reactive solution to handle responsive design without manually managing `resize` event listeners.

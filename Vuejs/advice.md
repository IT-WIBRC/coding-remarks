## 1. Composable/Utility Function Export Pattern

**Guideline:** For most composables and utility functions (i.e., `.js` or `.ts` files that export functions), prefer declaring all functions at the top level and exporting them within an object (or as named exports if a single function is the primary export).

**Explanation:**

This approach enhances **testability** and **clarity**. When functions are declared and exported as properties of an object (or as named exports), they provide clear, explicit entry points for testing and mocking dependencies. This avoids the complexities that can arise with closures, especially when they encapsulate internal state that is hard to reset or mock in tests.

**Example (Preferred):**

```typescript
// useMyUtility.ts
const internalState = ref(0); // If truly module-level shared state is intended

export const myFunctionA = () => { /* ... */ };
export const myFunctionB = () => { /* ... */ };

// If you need to return a cohesive API, an object is good:
export const useMyUtility = () => {
  // Access internalState or other functions
  return { myFunctionA, myFunctionB };
};
```

**Note on Stateful Composables:** If a composable *must* manage isolated internal state for each invocation (e.g., `useCounter()` where each counter should be independent), then the closure pattern (`const useCounter = () => { const count = ref(0); return { count }; }`) is appropriate. In such cases, the returned API (the object from the closure) is the unit that should be tested. This guideline primarily targets utilities that are intended to be stateless or share module-level state.

---

## 2. Module Import Style

**Guideline:** Wherever possible, use **named exports** and **named imports** (`import { myFunction } from '...'`) for utility functions, composables, and service modules (`.js` or `.ts` files).

**Explanation:**

* **Consistency:** Named exports enforce a single, canonical name for each exported entity. This makes it much easier to search the codebase, understand what a specific import refers to, and reduces cognitive load by eliminating ambiguity.
* **Refactoring Safety:** Renaming a named export is typically easier to refactor across a codebase with modern IDEs.

**Example (Preferred):**

```typescript
// myUtility.ts
export const formatCurrency = (amount: number) => { /* ... */ };

// someComponent.vue
import { formatCurrency } from '~/utils/myUtility';
// ...
```

**Exception for Vue Single File Components (.vue files):**

For Vue components defined in `.vue` files, it is generally recommended to use `export default defineComponent({ /* ... */ })`. This is the idiomatic and widely accepted pattern within the Vue ecosystem, and it clearly designates the primary component exported from that file. The component's name for debugging and testing purposes (`<MyComponent />`) is derived from its `name` option or its filename.

## 3. Tailwind CSS Color Configuration

**Guideline:** All design system colors should be configured directly in your `tailwind.config.js` file, utilizing Tailwind's opacity modifiers for variations.

**Explanation:**

* **Single Source of Truth:** Your `tailwind.config.js` becomes the central definition for your brand's color palette, ensuring consistency across the entire application.
* **Maintainability & Adaptability:** Changes to primary colors (e.g., brand rebranding) require only modifying the color definitions in one file, instantly updating everywhere it's used. This dramatically reduces maintenance overhead.
* **Reusability:** You can easily apply consistent color variations (e.g., `bg-primary/50` for 50% opacity, `text-secondary/[.85]` for 85% opacity) without hardcoding hex values or creating numerous custom utility classes.

**Example (`tailwind.config.js`):**

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          DEFAULT: '#3490dc', // Base color
          50: '#eff6ff',
          100: '#dbeafe',
          // ... other shades if needed, or rely on opacity modifiers
        },
        secondary: {
          DEFAULT: '#6574cd',
        },
        // ... define other semantic colors (e.g., 'accent', 'danger', 'success')
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
};
```

**Usage in Vue Components:**

```html
<template>
  <button class="bg-primary-DEFAULT text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-primary/80">
    Primary Button
  </button>
  <p class="text-secondary/60">A secondary color with 60% opacity.</p>
</template>
```

## 4. API Service Layer Design

**Guideline:** Implement API calls using dedicated "service" classes with static methods, rather than embedding API logic directly within stores or components.

**Explanation:**

This establishes a robust "Service Layer" in your architecture, offering several advantages:

* **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Service classes are solely responsible for interacting with external APIs (like Supabase). Stores manage application state, and components render the UI. This clear division makes reasoning about your codebase much easier.
* **Enhanced Testability:** Static methods are inherently easier to unit test in isolation. You can mock the service methods without needing to set up complex store or component states.
* **Reusability:** Service methods can be easily reused across different stores, composables, or even independent scripts if needed, promoting a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) codebase.
* **Consistent Error Handling:** By utilizing a wrapper function like `wrapServiceCall` within your service methods, all API interactions benefit from standardized error mapping and response parsing.

**Example:**

```typescript
// userService.ts
import supabase from './supabaseClient'; // Your configured Supabase client
import { wrapServiceCall } from '~/utils/wrapServiceCall'; // Your API wrapper

export class UserService {
  static async getUserProfile(userId: string) {
    return wrapServiceCall(
      supabase.from('profiles').select('*').eq('id', userId).single()
    );
  }

  static async updateUserName(userId: string, newName: string) {
    return wrapServiceCall(
      supabase.from('profiles').update({ name: newName }).eq('id', userId).single()
    );
  }
}

// In a store:
import { UserService } from '~/services/userService';
import { handleSingleItemResponse } from '~/utils/serviceResponseUtilities'; // For consuming wrapper result

class ProfileStore {
  userProfile = ref(null);

  async fetchProfile(userId: string) {
    const wrapperResponse = await UserService.getUserProfile(userId);

    return handleSingleItemResponse(wrapperResponse, {
      onFound: (data) => {
        this.userProfile.value = data;
        return { status: "success", data };
      },
      onNotFound: () => ({ status: "error", message: "Profile not found." }),
      onError: (message) => ({ status: "error", message }),
    });
  }
}
```

## 5. Store (State Management) Usage Scope

**Guideline:** Restrict the use of your state management store (e.g., Pinia, Vuex) primarily for:

* **Global Application State:** Information that is truly application-wide and needs to be accessible by multiple, disparate components (e.g., user authentication status, global loading indicators, feature flags).
* **Session-Persistent Data:** Information that needs to be maintained across the user's session (e.g., `currentUser`, `jwtToken`, `currentTheme`).
* **Cached Reference Data:** Data that is fetched once and rarely changes, used by many parts of the application (e.g., list of countries, product categories).

**Explanation:**

This disciplined approach prevents stores from becoming "god objects" that encapsulate too much logic and state. It encourages developers to:

* **Prefer Local State:** Utilize component-level reactive state (`ref`, `reactive`) for data that is only relevant to a specific component or its immediate children.
* **Leverage Composables:** Use composables for reusable logic and localized state that can be encapsulated and reused across multiple components without polluting the global store.
* **Improve Performance:** Minimizing global reactive state can reduce reactivity overhead and make debugging easier by narrowing down the sources of state changes.

---

## 6. Reactivity with `shallowRef`

**Guideline:** Avoid using `shallowRef` for general application state within `defineComponent` (or `<script setup>`) unless you have a specific, well-understood performance optimization in mind. Prefer `ref` for most cases.

**Explanation:**

* **`ref` (Deep Reactivity - Default):** When you use `ref({ key: 'value' })`, Vue creates a "deeply reactive" object. Changes to `ref.value` *or* any nested properties (`ref.value.key = 'new_value'`) will trigger template updates. This is the intuitive and expected behavior for most state.
* **`shallowRef` (Shallow Reactivity):** When you use `shallowRef({ key: 'value' })`, Vue only tracks changes if you **reassign the entire `.value` property** (`shallowRef.value = { anotherKey: 'another_value' }`). Changes to nested properties (`shallowRef.value.key = 'new_value'`) **will NOT trigger updates**.

**Why avoid `shallowRef` by default?**
Using `shallowRef` when deep reactivity is expected can lead to hard-to-debug issues where your data changes but the UI doesn't update. It's a tool for advanced performance optimization when you explicitly know you will only be replacing the entire object/array inside the ref, or when you are wrapping an external library's object that manages its own reactivity. For general component state, `ref` provides the more robust and predictable behavior.

---

## 7. Component Stubbing in Tests

**Guideline:** When stubbing Vue components in your tests (e.g., with Vue Test Utils), always refer to the component by its **registered component name** in the `global.stubs` (or local `stubs`) option.

**Explanation:**

Vue identifies components by their registered name within the application's component tree. This name is typically:

* The value of the `name` option in `defineComponent({ name: 'MyComponent', ... })`.
* In `<script setup>`, it's automatically inferred from the filename (e.g., `MyComponent.vue` implies a name of `'MyComponent'`).
* The name used during global registration (`app.component('MyGlobalComponent', MyGlobalComponent)`).

**Common Pitfall:** Do **NOT** use the name you give a component when you import it (e.g., `import MyAlias from './MyComponent.vue';`). The alias is only relevant within that specific file; Vue's rendering engine doesn't know the component by that alias.

**Example (Vue Test Utils):**

```typescript
// MyComponent.vue
<script setup lang="ts">
// This component's registered name will be 'MyComponent'
</script>
<template><div>My Component</div></template>

// MyParentComponent.vue (using MyComponent)
<script setup lang="ts">
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue';
</script>
<template><MyComponent /></template>

// MyParentComponent.spec.ts (testing MyParentComponent)
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';
import MyParentComponent from './MyParentComponent.vue';

describe('MyParentComponent', () => {
  it('renders correctly with MyComponent stubbed', () => {
    const wrapper = mount(MyParentComponent, {
      global: {
        stubs: {
          // Correct: refer to it by its registered name 'MyComponent'
          MyComponent: true, // Stubs the component with a minimal placeholder
          // Incorrect:
          // MyAlias: true, // If you did `import MyAlias from './MyComponent.vue'`
        },
      },
    });
    expect(wrapper.html()).toContain('<mycomponent-stub>'); // The default stub output
  });
});
```

## 8. General Coding Advice for Better Code

Beyond Vue.js specifics, adhering to these general software engineering principles will significantly enhance the quality, maintainability, and collaboration in your projects.

### 8.1. Favor Modularity and Single Responsibility

**Advice:** Each function, class, or module should have one, and only one, reason to change. Break down complex tasks into smaller, focused units.

**Why:**
* **Easier Reasoning:** Smaller units are easier to understand, write, and debug.
* **Increased Reusability:** Highly focused modules are more likely to be reusable in different contexts.
* **Simplified Testing:** Testing a component with a single responsibility is straightforward.
* **Reduced Impact of Changes:** A change in one module is less likely to break unrelated parts of the system.

**Example:** Instead of a `UserService` that handles user data, authentication, and UI notifications, separate it into `UserService` (data), `AuthService` (auth logic), and a `NotificationComposable` (UI).

### 8.2. Embrace Immutability

**Advice:** When working with data, especially objects and arrays, prefer creating new copies or derived versions instead of directly modifying existing ones.

**Why:**
* **Predictability:** State changes are explicit and easier to track. You know exactly when and where data is being altered.
* **Easier Debugging:** Avoids subtle bugs caused by unexpected side effects when multiple parts of the application hold references to the same mutable object.
* **Simplified Reactivity:** In Vue, reassigning a `ref.value` with a new object/array (even if derived from the old one) is a clear signal for reactivity updates, which can be more predictable than deep mutations for complex objects.
* **Concurrency Safety:** While less common in typical frontend JavaScript, immutability is fundamental for safe concurrent programming.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Avoid:
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
user.age = 31; // Mutates original object

// Prefer:
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
const updatedUser = { ...user, age: 31 }; // Creates a new object
```

### 8.3. Practice Defensive Programming

**Advice:** Anticipate potential issues and write code that can gracefully handle unexpected inputs, missing data, or error conditions.

**Why:**
* **Robustness:** Makes your application more resilient to real-world data and user behavior.
* **Fewer Runtime Errors:** Prevents crashes and provides a better user experience by handling errors before they propagate.
* **Clearer Error Paths:** Explicitly defining how errors are handled makes the code easier to follow.

**Examples:**
* **Input Validation:** Always validate user input or data from APIs.
* **Optional Chaining (`?.`) and Nullish Coalescing (`??`):** Safely access nested properties (`user?.address?.street`) or provide default values (`data ?? 'N/A'`).
* **Guard Clauses:** Exit early from functions if preconditions are not met.
    ```typescript
    function processUser(user: User | null) {
      if (!user) {
        console.warn("No user to process.");
        return; // Exit early
      }
      // ... rest of logic assuming user is not null
    }
    ```
* **Default Parameters:** Provide sensible defaults for function arguments.

### 8.4. Consistent and Descriptive Naming

**Advice:** Use clear, unambiguous, and consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, components, and files.

**Why:**
* **Readability:** Good names reduce the need for comments and make the code self-documenting.
* **Maintainability:** Easier for others (and your future self) to understand the purpose and behavior of code.
* **Searchability:** Consistent names make it easier to find relevant code sections.

**Examples:**
* **Functions:** Use verbs (e.g., `fetchUsers`, `calculateTotalPrice`, `updateProfile`).
* **Booleans:** Use prefixes like `is`, `has`, `can` (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasPermission`, `canSubmit`).
* **Components:** PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfileCard`, `AppHeader`).
* **Variables:** camelCase (e.g., `userName`, `totalAmount`).
* **Files:** match component/module name (e.g., `UserProfileCard.vue`, `userService.ts`).

### 8.5. Leverage TypeScript Fully

**Advice:** Don't just use TypeScript; *embrace* it. Use explicit types, interfaces, utility types, and generic parameters to define your data shapes and function signatures accurately.

**Why:**
* **Early Error Detection:** Catches type-related bugs during development (compile-time) rather than at runtime.
* **Improved Readability and Understanding:** Types act as a form of living documentation, clearly defining data structures and API contracts.
* **Enhanced IDE Support:** Better autocompletion, refactoring tools, and navigation.
* **Refactoring Confidence:** Provides confidence that changes won't inadvertently break other parts of the system.

**Example:**
* Define interfaces for API responses and data models.
* Use `readonly` for properties that should not be changed after initialization.
* Use `type` aliases for complex union types or function signatures (like `ServiceWrapperResponse`).

### 8.6. Smart Error Handling & User Feedback

**Advice:** Beyond just logging errors (as `wrapServiceCall` does), ensure your application provides meaningful feedback to the user and considers how errors impact UX.

**Why:**
* **User Experience:** Inform users when something goes wrong and (ideally) suggest what they can do next.
* **Debugging in Production:** Good logging and error reporting to monitoring tools are critical for identifying issues in live environments.
* **Graceful Degradation:** The application should not crash or become unusable.

**Examples:**
* **Notifications/Toasts:** Display transient messages for successful operations, warnings, or non-critical errors.
* **Error Pages/Components:** Provide fallback UI for critical errors (e.g., "Something went wrong" page).
* **Retry Mechanisms:** For intermittent network errors, offer a "Retry" button.
* **Loading States:** Clearly indicate when data is being fetched to avoid user confusion.
* **Input Error Messages:** Provide immediate, specific feedback for form validation errors.

### 8.7. Automated Testing (Unit, Integration, E2E)

**Advice:** Prioritize and integrate automated tests at various levels of your application.

**Why:**
* **Confidence in Changes:** Tests provide a safety net, allowing you to refactor and add features with confidence that existing functionality isn't broken.
* **Bug Prevention:** Catch regressions and new bugs early in the development cycle.
* **Documentation:** Tests serve as executable documentation of how different parts of your code are supposed to behave.
* **Design Feedback:** Writing tests often forces you to design more modular, testable code.

**Levels:**
* **Unit Tests:** Focus on isolated functions, classes, and composables (e.g., `wrapServiceCall`, service methods).
* **Integration Tests:** Verify the interaction between a few modules (e.g., a component interacting with a store, a store interacting with a service).
* **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Simulate user journeys through the entire application (e.g., Cypress, Playwright).

### 8.8. Code Reviews & Pair Programming

**Advice:** Regularly conduct code reviews with your team members and consider pair programming for complex tasks.

**Why:**
* **Quality Improvement:** Fresh eyes can spot bugs, logical flaws, and areas for improvement.
* **Knowledge Sharing:** Disseminates knowledge about the codebase and different approaches.
* **Consistency:** Helps enforce coding standards and architectural guidelines.
* **Mentorship:** Provides opportunities for learning and growth within the team.
* **Increased Ownership:** Fosters shared ownership of the codebase.

### 8.9. Performance Awareness

**Advice:** Be mindful of performance implications, especially in large-scale applications.

**Why:**
* **User Experience:** Faster applications lead to better user satisfaction.
* **SEO:** Page load speed is a ranking factor for search engines.
* **Accessibility:** Performance can impact users on slower networks or less powerful devices.

**Examples:**
* **Lazy Loading:** Components, routes, and large libraries.
* **Virtual Scrolling:** For long lists.
* **Debouncing/Throttling:** For frequently triggered events (e.g., input, scroll).
* **Optimizing Network Requests:** Reducing payload size, caching, consolidating requests.
* **Vue Specifics:** Use `v-once` for static content, `v-memo` for memoization, understand reactivity pitfalls (e.g., unnecessary deep reactivity).

### 8.10. Continuous Learning & Refactoring

**Advice:** Software development is an evolving field. Continuously learn new patterns, tools, and best practices. Don't be afraid to refactor existing code to improve its quality, especially if you discover better approaches.

**Why:**
* **Adaptability:** Keeps your codebase modern and relevant.
* **Reduced Tech Debt:** Prevents small issues from accumulating into large, unmanageable problems.
* **Developer Growth:** Fosters a culture of improvement and professional development.

By embracing these principles, your team can build higher-quality, more sustainable, and enjoyable-to-work-with Vue.js applications.
